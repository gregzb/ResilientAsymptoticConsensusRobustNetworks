Currently only deal with the malicious, F-total model, but should extend easily to byzantine, F-local and f-fraction local.

## To-do:
* Add support for byzantile "malicious" nodes.
* Add support for F-local and f-fraction local.
* Add support for calculating the (r,s)-robustness of an arbitrary graph
* Add support for generating a graph with a certain number of nodes given (r, s)
